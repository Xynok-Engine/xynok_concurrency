//! ## One shared front for std and loom
//!
//! This crate is checked with loom, and loom can only see the concurrent operations it provides
//! itself. That means every atomic, every shared cell, every thread operation has to switch over to
//! loom's version during the checks, then switch back for a real build.
//!
//! Sprinkling `#[cfg]` everywhere to do that would bury the real code in noise, and missing a
//! single spot means loom never sees it, so the run comes back clean while the bug is still there.
//!
//! ### How it works
//!
//! The whole crate pulls these types from here instead of straight from std. This is the one place
//! that decides whose version to use, and nothing else has to care.
//!
//! Only the things that genuinely need swapping live here. Anything loom does not model, or that is
//! only used to measure a type's size rather than run concurrently, can just call std directly.
//!
//! > [!IMPORTANT]
//! > Do not reach for std directly for anything on the list below. One shortcut is enough for loom
//! > to lose track of exactly the part that needed watching.
